Simple Linear Regression

*Objective*

**Predict the optimum number of cluster on iris dataset.**

\

In this regression task I tried to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

***1. Import necessary Libraries***

This step involved division of data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs).
"""

X = s_data.iloc[:, :-1].values

"""Step 4 - Model Training

Splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training the algorithm.

Now since our model is trained now, its the time to visualize the best-fit line of regression.
"""

# Plotting the regression line

# Plotting for the test data
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, line,color='red');

Now that we have trained our algorithm, it's time to test the model by making some predictions.

For this we will use our test-set data

"""Step 8 - Evaluating the model

The final step is to evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. Here different errors have been calculated to compare the model performance and predict the accuracy.
